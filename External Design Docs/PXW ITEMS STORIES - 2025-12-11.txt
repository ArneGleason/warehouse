PXW ITEMS - Create new inventory item
Story
As a warehouse admin or supervisor I want to create a new inventory item (SKU) with required and optional attributes So that it can be used consistently across POs and warehouse operations

Acceptance Criteria
AC A — Navigate to “Add New Item” (Create mode)
	•	IN PX Warehouse – Item Master / Items List
	•	GIVEN I have permission to manage Item Master inventory

	•	Shows tab strip with:
	•	INFO tab active
	•	VENDOR SKUS tab visible but disabled (or not selectable) with count 0
	•	Shows footer actions: Cancel and Save Changes, with Save Changes disabled on initial load

AC B — Default state of the Create form
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN I have just opened the Create page
	•	WHEN the form loads
	•	SKU (Item #) field is empty and editable, with helper text indicating it cannot be changed once created
	•	Shows an AUTO NUMBER button next to the SKU field (Create mode only)
	•	Required attributes section is present with the fields (per current configuration):
	•	Category (dropdown)
	•	Manufacturer
	•	Model
	•	Grade (dropdown, includes RAW for no grade)
	•	Serialized (On/Off switch with helper text “On: each item has a serial. Off: track only total quantity”)
	•	Optional attributes section is present with helper text “categories may have different optional attributes – see settings” and no values selected yet
	•	Active/Inactive selector defaults to Active, with note “Items will not appear in selection lists” displayed when Inactive is chosen
	•	The description placeholder remains static until item data is sufficient to compute a description (per settings rules)

AC C — Auto-number SKU
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN auto-numbering is configured in settings
	•	WHEN I click AUTO NUMBER and the SKU field is currently empty
	•	System generates the next available SKU according to the configured auto-numbering rules
	•	Generated SKU is unique among all existing items
	•	Generated SKU is populated into the SKU (Item #) field
	•	Save state is re-evaluated (Save remains disabled until all required fields are valid)
	•	WHEN auto-numbering fails because configuration is missing or a unique SKU cannot be generated
	•	Leaves the SKU field unchanged
	•	Shows a non-blocking error message indicating that auto-numbering failed and that I can enter a SKU manually

AC D — Manual SKU entry & uniqueness validation
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN I am creating a new item
	•	WHEN I manually type a value into SKU (Item #)
	•	The value is treated as the item’s ID for this item once saved
	•	Basic validation applies (e.g., not blank, no forbidden characters per global SKU rules)
	•	WHEN I attempt to save a new item with a SKU that already exists for another item
	•	The save is rejected
	•	An inline error message is shown on the SKU field indicating the SKU must be unique
	•	The form remains on the Create page with all other entered values preserved
	•	AND once this item is successfully created
	•	The SKU value is stored as immutable (cannot be changed on subsequent edits of this item; enforcement will be verified in the Edit story)

AC E — Required & optional attributes behavior
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN the form is loaded
	•	WHEN I interact with Category
	•	I can only select from categories configured in Settings (no inline creation of new categories)
	•	Changing Category refreshes the set of optional attributes shown to those configured for the new category
	•	Any optional attribute values that are no longer valid for the new category are cleared
	•	WHEN I set Manufacturer or Model
	•	I can pick from existing values (case-insensitive matching)
	•	I can also create a new Manufacturer or Model inline (e.g., by typing a new value and confirming)
	•	Matching and storage is case-insensitive (e.g., “apple” matches “Apple”)
	•	WHEN I set Grade
	•	I must pick from the list of grades configured in Settings (including RAW when there is no grade)
	•	I cannot create new grades inline
	•	WHEN I set Capacity and Color
	•	I can pick from existing values or create new values inline (consistent with current attribute design)
	•	WHEN I set Optional Attributes
	•	I see only the attribute fields configured for the selected Category
	•	For each optional attribute, I can pick from existing values or create a new value inline
	•	Optional attributes may remain blank; they are not required to save
	•	Validation:
	•	To enable Save Changes, at minimum the following must be valid and non-empty:
	•	SKU (Item #)
	•	Category
	•	Manufacturer
	•	Model
	•	Grade
	•	Any missing required field keeps Save Changes disabled and surfaces an inline error once the field has been touched/blurred

AC F — Serialized switch
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN the Serialized switch is visible with helper text “On: each item has a serial. Off: track only total quantity”
	•	WHEN I toggle the Serialized switch to On
	•	The item will be created as serialized (inventory must be tracked with individual serials in downstream flows)
	•	WHEN I toggle the Serialized switch to Off
	•	The item will be created as non-serialized (inventory can be tracked by quantity only)
	•	AND:
	•	Serialized has a valid default (e.g., Off) so it does not block enabling of Save Changes once all other required fields are valid
	•	The current Serialized value is saved and will be respected wherever this item is used in the warehouse

AC G — Active / Inactive setting
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN the Active/Inactive selector is visible
	•	WHEN I leave the default as Active and save
	•	The item is created as Active and is eligible to appear in item selection lists (e.g., when creating POs, assigning inventory, etc.)
	•	WHEN I choose Inactive before saving
	•	The item is created as Inactive
	•	Inactive items do not appear in item-selection lists for new transactions (per note: “Items will not appear in selection lists”)
	•	The item record still exists and can be managed from the Items List / Item Details (e.g., later re-activated or inspected; detailed behavior may be covered in a future story)

AC H — Description preview
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN a description pattern has been defined in Settings
	•	WHEN I populate the SKU and required attributes (and optional attributes, as relevant to the pattern)
	•	The description preview area updates to show the computed description based on the configured rules (e.g., Manufacturer + Model + Capacity + Color + Grade)
	•	The preview is read-only on this page (i.e., it is derived, not directly editable)
	•	WHEN required fields are incomplete or the pattern cannot be applied
	•	The placeholder text remains, or the description preview indicates that more information is required per settings

AC I — Save new item (success) & navigation
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN SKU is unique and all required fields are valid
	•	WHEN I click Save Changes
	•	The system creates the new item with all the provided values (SKU, attributes, Serialized, Active/Inactive, etc.)
	•	I am returned to the Items List page
	•	The newly created item appears in the Items List according to the current filters (e.g., it may not appear if filters exclude it or if it was created as Inactive)
	•	(For future Edit story) The new item now has a non-editable SKU and an enabled VENDOR SKUS tab

AC J — Cancel / Back
	•	IN Item Details – [NEW], INFO tab
	•	GIVEN I am on the Create page with or without unsaved changes
	•	WHEN I click the header back chevron
	•	I am returned to the Items List page
	•	No new item is created and all unsaved changes are discarded
	•	WHEN I click Cancel
	•	Same behavior as the back chevron: return to Items List and discard unsaved changes

	•	Shows tabs:
	•	INFO tab selected
	•	VENDOR SKUS tab enabled and displaying the current count (e.g., VENDOR SKUS 0)
	•	Shows footer actions: Cancel and Save Changes, with Save Changes initially disabled until changes are made

	•	The edited field accepts valid values according to the same rules as Create:
	•	Category: select from existing categories defined in Settings (no inline creation)
	•	Manufacturer/Model/Capacity/Color: pick from existing or create new values inline (case-insensitive matching)
	•	Grade: pick from configured grades in Settings (no inline grade creation; RAW used when no grade)
	•	Optional attributes: show fields for attributes configured for the current Category; allow pick from existing or create new values inline
	•	Any change marks the form as “dirty” and enables Save Changes if the item remains valid
	•	The description line under the header is recomputed based on the settings rules whenever relevant fields change (e.g., Manufacturer, Model, Capacity, Color, Grade)
	•	Validation:
	•	The same required-fields rules as Create apply: SKU (pre-filled), Category, Manufacturer, Model, Grade, Capacity, and Color must be valid and non-empty
	•	If a required field is cleared or set to an invalid value, Save Changes becomes disabled (or is prevented on click) and an inline error is shown for that field after it is touched/blurred

AC E — Serialized switch in edit
	•	IN Item Details – Edit, INFO tab
