1. Run the session manager to backup the database and commit changes.
   Replace `[Task Name]` with a short description of what you are working on.
   ```bash
   node session_manager.js suspend "[Task Name]"
   ```
2. Stop all running terminal processes (server and client).
   // turbo
   ```bash
   pkill -f "node index.js" || true
   pkill -f "next" || true
   ```
3. Notify the user with the "Resume Token" phrase generated by the script.
